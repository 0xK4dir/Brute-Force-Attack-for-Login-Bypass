# Brute-Force-Attack-for-Login-Bypass

Modern organizations depend on user authentication to protect systems, data, and services.
Despite the availability of strong authentication mechanisms, weak passwords, misconfigured
rate limits, and inadequate monitoring still allow adversaries to attempt brute force login
attacksâ€”systematic trials of many password candidates until one succeeds. This project
designs and evaluates a controlled, ethical simulation of brute force attacks against a purposebuilt login service, with the goal of understanding attack behavior, measuring risk, and
validating defensive controls such as rate limiting, account lockout, CAPTCHA, IP reputation,
and multi-factor authentication (MFA).


Prevention Techniques
1. Use Strong Passwords.
2. Limit Login Attempts.
3. Monitor IP addresses.
4. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
5. Use CAPTCHAs.
6. Use Unique Login URLs
7. Disable Root SSH Logins
8. Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
